In order to use this code, first install the latest CUDD libraries. If
you compile the libraries yourself, make sure to call "make" AND "make
objlib", the latter is used for the C++ interface used in this code. Also
make sure that the libraries are compiled in 32bit mode (if the planner is
also compiled in 32bit). For this, uncomment line 72 in the cudd Makefile
and instead comment out line 70. In the Makefile in the obj Folder, add -m32
to the CXXFLAGS variable on line 17.

When the libraries are compiled, set the variable CUDD_DIR in the Makefile
in this directory to the root folder of your CUDD installation.

In order to use CUDD in the fast Downward code, modify the Makefile in the
search directory in the following way:
1) Line 29: set DOWNWARD_USE_CUDD to 1
2) Line 31: set the root directory of your CUDD installation
