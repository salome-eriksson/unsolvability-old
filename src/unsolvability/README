In order to use this code, first install the latest CUDD libraries. If you
compile the libraries yourself, make sure to call "make" AND "make objlib",
the latter is used for the C++ interface used in this code. Then set the
variable CUDD_DIR in the Makefile to the root folder of your CUDD installation.
